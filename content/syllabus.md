## Course Philosophy

This course is designed as a **studio-based software development experience** rather than a traditional lecture-driven class. The central goal is to help students learn how to **build real software for a real client under real constraints**, while working collaboratively in a shared codebase.

The course emphasizes **professional practice over isolated technical mastery**. Students will learn not only how to implement features, but how to:
- reason about design tradeoffs,
- work within an existing system,
- communicate intent through code, tests, and reviews,
- coordinate work with others over time.

Rather than treating the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) as a linear checklist, this course treats it as an **iterative, ongoing process** that unfolds alongside implementation. Design, testing, and reflection are interleaved with coding throughout the semester.

Because this is a studio course, learning depends heavily on **in-person participation, critique, and collaboration**. Regular attendance and engagement are therefore essential to meeting the learning objectives.


## General Overview of the Course Structure

The course is organized into two main phases:

### Phase 1: System Literacy, Design Foundations, and Parallel Exploration (Weeks 1–8)

In the first half of the semester, students work in small teams using a **shared starter system** provided by the instructors. The goals of this phase are to:

- Develop architectural literacy in an existing backend/frontend system,
- Practice contributing safely using tests and code reviews,
- Apply software design principles in context,
- Reconnect technical decisions to user needs through design and prototyping.

During Phase 1, all teams work on similar features and problems. This deliberate constraint allows students to focus on **process, coordination, and reasoning**, rather than feature differentiation.

### Phase 2: Integration, Shared Ownership, and Delivery (Weeks 9–15)

In the second half of the semester, the class transitions to a **shared codebase** that becomes the source of truth. Students reorganize into new teams and work on **distinct vertical feature slices** driven by client needs and sprint planning.

This phase emphasizes:
- Collaboration at scale,
- Integration and coordination,
- Managing tradeoffs between scope, quality, and time,
- Delivering a coherent product to a real stakeholder.


## Client & Project Context

In this course, students collaborate with a real-world client focused on **supporting parents of young children with motor delays**.

The project centers on building a web-based platform that helps parents:
- understand evidence-based exercises and activities,
- learn how and why specific approaches support motor development,
- access structured, trustworthy guidance outside of clinical settings.

This work is conducted in collaboration with **Emory University** and **Appalachian State University**, drawing on interdisciplinary expertise in child development, physical therapy, and education.

The client context introduces authentic constraints:
- requirements evolve as understanding deepens,
- design decisions must account for accessibility and clarity,
- technical choices must support maintainability and long-term use.

Students are expected to approach this work with professionalism, empathy, and respect for the population the software is intended to support.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Contribute effectively to an existing software system**
   - Understand and work within established architectural patterns
   - Make scoped, testable changes using professional workflows

2. **Apply software design principles in context**
   - Reason about cohesion, coupling, and changeability
   - Justify design decisions and tradeoffs

3. **Use testing as a tool for specification and safety**
   - Write tests that document intended behavior
   - Use tests to refactor and extend code confidently

4. **Collaborate through professional development practices**
   - Communicate intent via pull requests and code reviews
   - Provide and respond to constructive technical feedback

5. **Integrate design and user-centered thinking into development**
   - Translate user needs into system behavior
   - Use low- and high-fidelity prototypes to inform implementation

6. **Navigate the software development lifecycle in practice**
   - Balance design, implementation, testing, and delivery
   - Adapt to evolving requirements and constraints


## Assessment

Assessment in this course emphasizes **process, reasoning, and collaboration**, not just feature output.

Grades are based on the following components:

1. **Technical Contributions (Pull Requests) — 35%**

    Assesses the ability to implement coherent, well-scoped changes within an existing codebase, including appropriate use of tests and adherence to project conventions.

1. **Code Reviews — 15%**

    Assesses engagement with peer work through substantive review comments that address behavior, design, testing, or tradeoffs.

1. **Testing Contributions — 20%**

    Assesses the use of tests to specify behavior, reduce risk, and support safe iteration across backend and frontend components.

1. **Design & SDLC Artifacts — 15%**

    Assesses design work and reflection, including prototypes, design rationales, and short written reflections tied to concrete decisions.

1. **Studio Participation — 15%**

    Assesses in-class engagement, including participation in studio activities, critique sessions, and collaborative work. Because this is a studio course, participation cannot be fully replicated outside of class.

> **Important Note:**  
> This course is intentionally designed so that meaningful progress requires regular participation. Students who are not present and engaged will be unable to meet the learning objectives, regardless of technical ability.

The sections below explain how individual and team-based work factor into these assessments.

### Individual and Team-Based Assessment

This course reflects the reality of professional software development: **software is built collaboratively**, but **learning and evaluation occur at the individual level**. Assessment in this course intentionally balances both.

#### 1. How Assessment Works

Students are evaluated as **individual contributors working within team-based projects**. You will collaborate closely with others, but your grade is not determined solely by your team’s output.

Instead, assessment is based on **observable individual contributions made in a team context**, as well as selected team-level outcomes.

#### 2. What Is Assessed Individually

The following components are assessed at the **individual level**:

- **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Your authored PRs are evaluated for clarity of intent, scope, correctness, use of tests, and adherence to project conventions.

- **Code Reviews**: Review comments you write on peers’ PRs are assessed for substance and engagement (e.g., questions about behavior, design tradeoffs, or testing), not for “correctness.”

- **Testing Contributions**: Tests you write are assessed for how well they specify intended behavior and reduce risk, rather than for coverage metrics.

- **Design and SDLC Reflections**: Short written reflections and design artifacts are assessed based on how clearly they connect decisions to constraints, user needs, and tradeoffs.

These artifacts allow the instructor to evaluate your understanding, effort, and professional practice independently of team dynamics.

#### 3. What Is Assessed at the Team Level

Some aspects of the course are necessarily **team-based**, including:

- Integrated system behavior
- Sprint demos and milestones
- Shared design coherence
- Client-facing deliverables

These components reflect how well the team coordinated work and delivered a coherent product.

#### 4. Eligibility for Team Credit

Team-based credit assumes **active participation**. To be eligible for full team credit, students must:

- Attend and engage in studio sessions regularly,
- Contribute to pull requests and reviews,
- Participate in required studio activities.

Students who are frequently absent or disengaged may have their grades **decoupled from team outcomes** and may be reassigned to individual alternative work.

#### 5. Phase-Based Emphasis

The balance between individual and team assessment shifts over the semester:

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–8):**  
  Emphasis is primarily on **individual assessment**, as all students are learning the system architecture, workflows, and conventions.

- **Phase 2 (Weeks 9–15):**  
  Assessment places greater weight on **team outcomes**, with individual contribution still assessed through PRs, reviews, and participation.

This shift reflects the move from parallel exploration to shared ownership and delivery.

> **Important Clarification**
> Strong team outcomes do not automatically guarantee high individual grades, and strong individual effort does not override a lack of participation in required studio work. Grades reflect **how you contribute**, not just what the team produces.




## Topics
- Please see the [course schedule](./)


## Attendance & Participation Policy

This course is structured as a studio-based software development course. Much of the learning occurs through in-class critique, collaboration, code review, and design discussion, which cannot be replicated asynchronously. As a result, regular attendance and active participation are required.

### Attendance Expectations

Students are expected to attend and participate in all studio sessions (Tuesday/Thursday).

- Occasional absences are understood; however, more than three (3) unexcused absences places a student at risk of not meeting the course learning objectives.
- Excused absences must follow university policy and be communicated in advance when possible.

### Participation as a Course Requirement

Participation in this course is not passive presence. It includes:

- Engaging in studio activities and discussions
- Contributing to in-class code reviews and critiques
- Collaborating with teammates during scheduled studio time

Because participation is integral to the course design, certain forms of credit (e.g., studio participation, team-based assessment, and some PR/review credit) require in-class engagement and cannot be fully made up outside of class.

### Impact of Repeated Absences

The following escalation process will be used consistently:

**After two (2) unexcused absences**, the instructors will contact the student to check in and remind them that continued absences will affect their ability to pass the course.

**After three (3) unexcused absences**, the student will receive a formal warning that they are at risk of failing the course due to insufficient participation in required studio work.

**After four (4) or more unexcused absences**, one or more of the following actions may occur:

- Reduction or cap on participation credit
- Removal from team-based work and reassignment to an individual, reduced-scope alternative
- Recommendation to withdraw from the course

These actions reflect the reality that students who are not present cannot meaningfully participate in collaborative software development.

### Team-Based Accountability

This course involves sustained teamwork. If a student's lack of attendance or engagement significantly impacts their team:

- The instructors may intervene
- Team responsibilities may be reassigned
- The student's grade may be decoupled from team outcomes

This is intended to protect students who are consistently present and contributing.

### Important Note

This policy is not intended to be punitive. It reflects the professional reality that software development is collaborative and time-bound, and that consistent participation is necessary to meet the course objectives. Students who anticipate attendance challenges should speak with the instructors as early as possible.

## Draft Generative AI Policy
To be refined in class...

### Students shall…
* Give credit to AI tools whenever used, even if only to generate ideas rather than usable text or code.
* When using AI tools on assignments, add an appendix showing:
  1. The entire exchange, highlighting the most relevant sections
  2. Description of precisely which AI tools were used (e.g. ChatGPT private subscription version, CoPilot, etc.)
  3. An explanation of how the AI tools were used (e.g. to generate ideas, understand functions or coding ideas, etc.)
  4. An account of why AI tools were used (e.g. to save time, to to stimulate thinking, to handle mounting stress, to clarify prose, to experiment for fun, etc.).
* Not use AI tools during in-class examinations unless explicitly permitted and instructed.
* Use AI tools wisely and intelligently, aiming to deepen understanding of subject matter and to support learning.

### The instructors shall…
* Seek to understand the strengths and weaknesses or AI tools for teaching and learning, to optimize their value for student learning.
* Impose a significant penalty for:
  * Using code that you do not understand and/or cannot clearly explain.
  * Low-energy or unreflective reuse of material generated by AI tools and/or merely reproducing the output from AI tools.

### This policy recognizes that…
* This policy depends on goodwill, a sense of fairness, and honorable character.
* This policy takes account of the existence of subscription versions of AI tools, which are not affordable for some students; the policy may need to be revised as the differences between subscription and free versions become better understood.
* This policy may be revised in light of other policies and novel technological developments in AI tools.

### Religious Accommodations
UNC Asheville accords students, on an individual basis, the opportunity to observe their traditional religious holy days. Students desiring to observe a religious holy day of special importance must notify me directly (suggested time frames: two weeks of the start of the semester or at least seven business days in advance of the scheduled observance). The request should be made in writing and should state (1) the specific accommodation being requested, (2) the religious practice or belief the student holds, (3) how the requested accommodation enables the student to participate in their religious practice or belief, and (4) the date(s) and/or frequency of the requested accommodation. We will then meet to discuss what reasonable accommodation will be implemented, such as options for missed discussions, exams, or other assignments. You are entitled to make up assignments without penalty due to an excused absence for a religious observance. Students may request a minimum of two excused absences per academic year for religious observances. The Office for Institutional Integrity & Access is available as a resource if students or faculty have questions about this process.

### Academic Alerts
Faculty at UNC Asheville have access to an Academic Alert system. The purpose of this system is to support communication with students about their progress in courses, especially if there are concerns (e.g., academic difficulty, attendance problems). Professors use the Alert system because they are invested in their students’ success. Entering an academic alert is a great way to supplement open conversations between instructors and students about how students can improve their academic performance. 

Alerts should not replace your direct outreach to and communication with the student. They are intended to serve as a way to document your concern and outreach and/or activate the larger support system for the student as needed. Hence, an alert should only be entered after the instructors have reached out to the student directly.

When a faculty member submits an alert that expresses a concern, the student receives outreach from their academic advisor or the team in the Office of Academic Advising. Students are no longer receiving automated notification emails when an alert is submitted. It is in the student's best interest to address the alert quickly, as students who do so are more likely to earn credit for the course. Questions about the Academic Alert system can be directed to Anne Marie Roberts (amrober1@unca.edu) in the <a href="https://www.unca.edu/academics/academic-success/" target="_blank">Academic Success Center</a>.

### Academic Honesty
The university’s policy on academic honesty states that “As a community of scholars dedicated to learning and the pursuit of knowledge UNC Asheville relies on the honesty and academic integrity of all the members of its community. Any act of plagiarism or cheating is academic dishonesty. A person who knowingly assists another in cheating is likewise guilty of cheating. According to the instructors' view of the gravity of the offense, a student may be punished by a failing grade or a grade of zero for the assignment or test, or a failing grade in the course. If it seems warranted, the instructors may also recommend to the Provost dismissal or other serious university sanction.” I expect that you will exercise integrity in all quizzes, exams, and written assignments. Please email me or pop in during student hours if you have additional questions or need clarification on any point. You can find additional information regarding the policy and potential grievance procedures here: <a href="ttps://studenthandbook.unca.edu/student-conduct/academic-misconduct-and-grievances-procedures/" target="_blank">https://studenthandbook.unca.edu/student-conduct/academic-misconduct-and-grievances-procedures/</a> (this link is broken and I can't find the new link).
