      "question": "What is the central philosophy of this course?",
      "options": [
        "Traditional lecture-driven learning with isolated technical mastery",
        "Studio-based software development experience building real software for a real client",

        "Focus on theoretical concepts without practical application"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This course is designed as a studio-based software development experience where students work as a development team building real software for a real client, operating under real technical, organizational, and time constraints."

        "To work independently without collaboration",
        "To learn only backend development"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "During Phase 1, all teams work on similar features and problems. This deliberate constraint allows students to focus on process, coordination, and reasoning, rather than feature differentiation."

    {
      "id": "q6",
      "question": "Why is regular attendance essential in this course?",
      "options": [
        "Because all lectures are recorded and attendance is optional",
        "Because learning depends heavily on in-person participation, critique, and collaboration",
        "Because there are no assignments outside of class",
        "Because the final exam is worth 100% of the grade"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Because this is a studio course, learning depends heavily on in-person participation, critique, and collaboration. Many skills required to deliver value to a client can only be practiced in a shared, synchronous setting."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Students are evaluated as individual contributors working within team-based projects. You will collaborate closely with others, but your grade is not determined solely by your team's output. Assessment is based on observable individual contributions made in a team context."
    },
    {
      "id": "q11",
      "question": "Which of the following is assessed at the individual level?",
      "options": [

      "id": "q13",
      "question": "What is the relationship between strong team outcomes and individual grades?",
      "options": [
        "Strong team outcomes automatically guarantee high individual grades",
        "Strong individual effort overrides lack of participation in required studio work",
        "Strong team outcomes do not automatically guarantee high individual grades, and strong individual effort does not override lack of participation",
        "Individual grades are completely independent of team outcomes"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Strong team outcomes do not automatically guarantee high individual grades, and strong individual effort does not override a lack of participation in required studio work. Grades reflect how you contribute, not just what the team produces."
