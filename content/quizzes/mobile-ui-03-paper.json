      "question": "Why should you use a component library like React Native Paper?",
      "options": [
        "It's required by React Native",
        "It provides pre-built components, consistent design, accessibility features, theming, and well-tested components",
        "It's faster than writing your own components",
        "It's the only way to style React Native apps"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Component libraries like React Native Paper provide: pre-built components (Buttons, Cards, TextInputs, etc.), consistent design (all components follow Material Design), built-in accessibility features, easy theming, and well-tested components used by thousands of apps."

      "question": "Consider the following code snippet:\n\n```tsx\n<Button mode=\"contained\" onPress={handlePress}>\n  Click me\n</Button>\n```\n\nWhat does `mode=\"contained\"` do?",
      "options": [
        "It's required for all buttons",
        "It sets the button style variant (contained, outlined, text, or elevated)",

        "It sets the button color"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
