      "question": "What does the `-d` flag do in `docker compose up -d`?",
      "options": [
        "Runs containers in detached mode (background)",
        "Deletes all containers first",
        "Shows debug output",
        "Downloads images from the internet"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The `-d` flag runs containers in detached mode, meaning they run in the background and don't block your terminal. This is useful so you can continue using your terminal while containers run."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "Why is it important to use `docker compose down --rmi all -v --remove-orphans` before a complete rebuild?",
      "options": [
        "It speeds up the rebuild process",
        "It ensures all old images, volumes, and orphaned containers are removed, giving you a truly fresh start",
        "It saves disk space temporarily",
        "It's not important - you can skip this step"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This command removes all images (`--rmi all`), volumes (`-v`), and orphaned containers (`--remove-orphans`), ensuring a completely clean slate. This is important when you want to eliminate any cached or stale data that might cause issues."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "What do the `-it` flags do in `docker exec -it tma_backend bash`?",
      "options": [
        "They make the command run faster",
        "They provide an interactive terminal, allowing you to type commands and see output in real-time",
        "They delete the container after use",
        "They run the command as root"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The `-i` flag keeps STDIN open (interactive), and `-t` allocates a pseudo-TTY (terminal). Together, they allow you to interact with the container's shell as if you were logged into it directly."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "question": "What does the `--reset` flag do in `scripts/populate.py --reset`?",
      "options": [
        "It drops all tables and recreates them with fresh data",
        "It only adds new data without removing old data",
        "It backs up the database first",
        "It skips populating certain tables"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The `--reset` flag drops all existing tables and recreates them from scratch with fresh seed data. This is useful when you want to start with a clean database state, especially after schema changes or when testing."
