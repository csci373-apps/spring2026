    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "What does JWT stand for and what is its primary characteristic?",
      "options": [
        "JavaScript Web Token - a client-side only token",
        "Java Web Token - a stateful session token",
        "JSON Web Transfer - a data transfer protocol",
        "JSON Web Token - a stateless, self-contained token format"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It's a stateless, self-contained token format that encodes user identity and permissions in the token itself, without requiring server-side session storage."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "Why are JWTs preferred over session-based authentication for mobile apps?",
      "options": [
        "JWTs are stateless and don't require server-side session storage, making them ideal for cross-platform authentication",
        "JWTs are smaller in size",
        "JWTs are faster to process",
        "JWTs don't expire"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "JWTs are stateless and don't require server-side session storage, making them ideal for mobile apps and SPAs where cookies aren't automatically sent. The same backend can authenticate both web and mobile clients."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "What HTTP header should clients use to send JWT tokens in requests?",
      "options": [
        "`Cookie: token=<token>`",
        "`X-Auth-Token: <token>`",
        "`Authorization: Bearer <token>`",
        "`X-JWT: <token>`"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Clients should send JWT tokens in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. This is the standard format for token-based authentication."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "question": "What is role-based access control?",
      "options": [
        "A database indexing strategy",
        "A method for encrypting passwords",
        "A system that restricts access based on a user's role (e.g., admin, manager, user)",
        "A token refresh mechanism"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Role-based access control restricts access to resources based on a user's role. For example, only admins can delete users, while regular users can only view their own data."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "question": "What is the security risk of storing sensitive data in JWT payloads?",
      "options": [
        "JWT payloads are base64-encoded, not encrypted - anyone with the token can decode and read the contents",
        "There is no security risk",
        "JWTs automatically encrypt all data",
        "JWTs are too large to store sensitive data"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "JWT payloads are base64-encoded, not encrypted. Anyone who has the token can decode it and read the contents. Never store sensitive data like passwords or credit card numbers in JWT payloads."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "question": "What should you do with the `SECRET_KEY` used to sign JWT tokens?",
      "options": [
        "Use the same secret key for all applications",
        "Hardcode it in the source code for easy access",
        "Store it as an environment variable and never commit it to version control",
        "Share it in documentation"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The `SECRET_KEY` must be kept secret. Store it as an environment variable and never commit it to version control. If compromised, attackers could forge tokens."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "question": "What should you use to hash passwords before storing them in the database?",
      "options": [
        "Plain text - it's easier to debug",
        "Base64 encoding - it's reversible",
        "bcrypt - a secure password hashing algorithm that handles salting automatically",
        "MD5 - it's fast and secure"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Use bcrypt (or similar secure hashing algorithms) to hash passwords. bcrypt automatically handles salting, which prevents rainbow table attacks. Never store passwords in plain text."
    }
