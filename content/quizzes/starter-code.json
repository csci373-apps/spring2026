      "question": "What is the purpose of design tokens in the starter code?",
      "options": [
        "To manage authentication tokens",
        "To provide named constants for colors, spacing, and typography that can be referenced throughout the codebase",
        "To generate API tokens",
        "To create database connection strings"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Design tokens are foundational design decisions (colors, spacing, typography) stored as named constants. This makes it easier to maintain consistency and update the design system globally."
