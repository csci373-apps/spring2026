      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using React. Instead of rendering to the web browser's DOM, React Native renders to native mobile components."

      "question": "What is the key difference between React (Web) and React Native?",
      "options": [
        "React Native uses HTML elements",
        "React (Web) renders to DOM; React Native renders to native mobile components",
        "React Native doesn't support JavaScript",
        "There is no difference"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "React (Web) renders to the DOM (HTML elements), while React Native renders to native mobile components (iOS UIView or Android View). Both use the same React concepts, but the underlying rendering is completely different."

        "They both use CSS for styling",
        "They both run in browsers"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Both React (Web) and React Native use the same core React concepts: components, props, state, hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.), and JSX syntax. The main differences are in rendering targets and styling approaches."

      "explanation": "Expo Router is a file-based routing system where the folder structure in the `app/` directory determines your app's navigation and screens. For example, `app/(tabs)/courses.tsx` creates a courses screen, and `app/(tabs)/courses/[id].tsx` creates a dynamic route for individual courses."

        "Mobile apps don't support navigation"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Web apps use URLs and browser navigation. Mobile apps use different navigation patterns: stack navigation (push/pop screens like browser history), tab navigation (bottom tabs like browser tabs), and drawer navigation (side menu). Expo Router handles this with file-based routing."

        "Because mobile devices are slow"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Many mobile APIs are async because they involve I/O operations: reading from storage, making network requests, and accessing device features (camera, location). Always use `async/await` or `.then()` when working with these APIs."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "If you know React for web, you're already 80% there! The React concepts (hooks, state, props, context) are exactly the same. The main differences are: components (use Paper instead of HTML), styling (use StyleSheet instead of CSS), navigation (use Expo Router instead of React Router), and platform APIs (use Expo SDK instead of browser APIs)."
