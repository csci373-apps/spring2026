      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Every PR should include: (1) What changed? (brief summary), (2) Why? (context or motivation), (3) How to test? (steps for reviewers), and (4) Screenshots/Examples (if UI changes). This helps reviewers understand the context and purpose of your changes."

        "A list of things to do after creating a PR",

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Before opening a PR, ensure: code works and compiles, tests pass, commit history is clean, branch is rebased on latest main, linting/formatting is done, and all debug code (console.logs, commented code) is removed."

        "Small enough to be reviewed in 15-30 minutes",

        "As large as possible to include everything"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Small PRs are easier to review and understand. Aim for PRs that can be reviewed in 15-30 minutes. Keep PRs focused - one feature or fix per PR."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-review your own PR before asking others. Look for typos, obvious bugs, and unclear code. This helps catch issues before your teammates review it."

      "explanation": "Review checklist includes: understand the change, code works and tests pass, tests are included for new functionality, code quality (clarity, naming, conventions), no obvious bugs, and documentation is clear."

        "Reading the PR description",
        "Leaving comments"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Testing the changes locally is very important! Reviewers sometimes skip this step, but pulling down the branch locally and running the code helps catch issues that might not be obvious from just reading the code."

        "They're all the same",
        "None of them matter",
        "Approve = ready to merge, Request changes = issues need fixing, Comment = optional feedback",
        "Approve = merge immediately, Request changes = optional, Comment = required"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Approve means the PR looks good and is ready to merge (after rebase if needed). Request changes means there are issues that need to be addressed before merging. Comment means you have feedback but it's not blocking (optional improvements)."

        "Nitpick on every style detail"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "When giving feedback: be constructive and kind, ask questions if unclear, suggest specific improvements, explain why you're suggesting a change, acknowledge what's good about the code, and focus on the code not the person."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "`--force-with-lease` is safe to use on feature branches after amending or rebasing. Never force push to `main` - it can overwrite important commits and cause problems for your team."

        "When code is broken but you want to save it"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Commit when you've completed a logical piece of work (e.g., 'Add tests for login endpoint'), code compiles, and tests pass. Each commit should represent a working state that you'd be okay showing in a PR."

        "Rebase is optional and not recommended",
        "Rebase creates a merge commit",
        "Rebase deletes all your commits",

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Rebase rewrites commit history by replaying your commits on top of the latest `main`. It creates a clean, linear history without merge commits. All PRs must be rebased before merging to ensure they're based on the latest code."

    {
      "id": "q13",
      "question": "What is the team fork structure in Phase 1?",
      "options": [
        "Each team member has their own fork",
        "Everyone works directly on the main repository",
        "One team member forks the repo, all members are collaborators on that fork, everyone works from the same fork",
        "Teams don't use forks"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In Phase 1, one team member forks the starter repository, all team members are added as collaborators on that fork, and everyone clones and pushes to the same fork. This ensures all team members can see each other's work."

        "Create a new branch"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Use interactive rebase to clean up your commit history. Change `pick` to `squash` for commits you want to combine. This creates a clean history that tells a good story and makes code reviews easier."
    },
    {
      "id": "q15",

        "Main is for experimental code only",
        "Only commit to main on weekends"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Never commit directly to `main`. Always create a feature branch for each feature/assignment. This keeps work isolated and makes code reviews easier before changes are merged."

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Use `git commit --amend` to update the last commit. This is useful when you realize the last commit has a bug or is incomplete. Use `--no-edit` to keep the same message, or `-m` to change it."
