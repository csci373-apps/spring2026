This course is organized into two distinct phases, each with different goals and workflows.

## Phase 1: Parallel Exploration (Weeks 1-8)

**Goal:** Build shared core functionality while learning design judgment, testing-as-specification, and studio critique.

**Structure:**
- Teams work in separate repositories
- Everyone builds the same core product
- Focus on learning through exploration and comparison

**What you'll practice:**
- Designing data models and APIs
- Writing tests as behavioral specifications
- Code reviews and studio critique
- Making design decisions and justifying tradeoffs

**By the end of phase 1,** you will have:
- Written backend, frontend, and test code
- Reviewed multiple peers’ PRs
- Articulated design intent in PRs
- Experienced critique as normal work
- Seen SDLC concepts inside real decisions

## Phase 2: Integration & Delivery (Weeks 9-14)

**Goal:** Shift from exploration to collaboration, integration, and client delivery.

**Structure:**
- Single shared codebase (instructor-maintained reference implementation)
- Vertical slice ownership
- Focus on collaboration and delivery

**What you'll practice:**
- Working in a shared codebase
- Integration and conflict resolution
- Professional collaboration workflows
- Delivering to a real client
