This agreement captures how your team will start working together.
You will revisit and revise it later, after you've had real experience working as a team. Keep this practical and honest. You are not expected to have everything figured out yet.

## 1. Communication

- What tool will we use for day-to-day communication?
- What is a reasonable response time during the week?
- What should someone do if they are blocked?

## 2. Availability & Presence

- When are we generally available outside of class?
- How will we notify the team if we can't attend a meeting?
- What does "showing up prepared" mean for us right now?

## 3. Collaboration Basics (Git & PRs)

- How will we share work in GitHub? (feature branches + PRs)
- **All PRs must have a linear history** (branches are rebased onto main; no merge commits)
- If a rebase is required, how will we ask for help?
- What is one workflow habit we want to avoid?

> **Note:** If you need to force-push after rebasing, use `git push --force-with-lease`.

## 4. Getting Help

- How will we raise concerns early?
- When should we ask the instructor for help?

## 5. Initial Roles

- Who is the initial point person for:

    - Integration (keeping branches in sync)
    - Documentation
    - Communication

- When will we revisit roles?

## Deliverable

Create a 1–2 page shared document (Google Doc or Markdown in your repo).
This is a working document — you will revise it later.

## Reflection (Discuss briefly as a team)

- What was easy to agree on?
- What felt unclear?
- What are we intentionally leaving open for now?
