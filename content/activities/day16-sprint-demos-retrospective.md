## Detailed Instructions

### Part 1: Welcome & Setup (5 minutes)

#### Welcome (2 minutes)
1. **Welcome back**
2. **Today's agenda:**
   - Sprint 1 demos (each team shows their work)
   - Phase 1 retrospective (what did we learn?)
   - Phase 2 transition (what's next?)

#### Demo Setup (3 minutes)

**Instructor provides:**
- **Demo order:** List of teams in order
- **Time limits:** 5-10 minutes per team
- **Format:** Live demo or recorded video
- **Equipment:** Ensure screens/projectors work

**Remind teams:**
- Show the feature working (not just code)
- Tell the story (user goal → how feature helps)
- Be prepared (test beforehand)
- Stay within time limit

**Key Point:** "Demos celebrate your work. Show what you built and what you learned."


### Part 2: Sprint 1 Demos (45 minutes)

#### Demo Format (5 minutes per team)

**Each team should:**
1. **Introduce the feature** (1 min)
   - What did you build?
   - What user goal does it support?

2. **Demo the feature** (3-5 min)
   - Show it working
   - Walk through the user flow
   - Highlight key interactions

3. **Technical highlights** (1-2 min)
   - What was interesting?
   - What challenges did you overcome?

4. **Reflection** (1 min)
   - What did you learn?
   - What would you do differently?

**Instructor:**
- Keep time (gently interrupt if over time)
- Ask clarifying questions
- Highlight interesting points
- Connect to learning objectives

**Audience:**
- Pay attention
- Ask questions (after demo)
- Learn from other teams' approaches

**Key Point:** "Each demo teaches us something. Learn from how other teams approached problems."

#### Between Demos (1-2 minutes)

**Quick discussion:**
- "What did you notice?"
- "What questions do you have?"
- "What patterns do you see?"

**Instructor:** Keep momentum, don't let discussions go too long

#### After All Demos (5 minutes)

**Instructor leads discussion:**

1. **What patterns did we see?**
   - Common approaches?
   - Common challenges?
   - Common solutions?

2. **What did we learn?**
   - What skills did teams develop?
   - What surprised us?
   - What impressed us?

3. **What's next?**
   - How does this prepare us for Phase 2?
   - What skills will we need?

**Key Point:** "Demos show our growth. We've learned a lot in Phase 1."

**Transition:** "Now let's reflect on Phase 1 as a whole..."


### Part 3: Phase 1 Retrospective (20 minutes)

#### Retrospective Framework (5 minutes)

**Instructor explains retrospective format:**

**Four questions:**
1. **What worked?** (What went well? What should we keep?)
2. **What didn't work?** (What was hard? What should we change?)
3. **What did we learn?** (What skills did we develop? What insights did we gain?)
4. **What will change in Phase 2?** (How will we apply what we learned?)

**Format:**
- Individual reflection (write notes)
- Team discussion (share with team)
- Class discussion (share insights)

#### Individual Reflection (5 minutes)

**Instructor asks students to reflect individually:**

**Write notes on:**
1. **What worked?**
   - What processes helped?
   - What tools were useful?
   - What collaboration worked?

2. **What didn't work?**
   - What was frustrating?
   - What took too long?
   - What was confusing?

3. **What did we learn?**
   - Technical skills?
   - Design skills?
   - Collaboration skills?

4. **What will change in Phase 2?**
   - How will we work differently?
   - What will we do more of? Less of?
   - What are we nervous about? Excited about?

**Instructor:** Give quiet time for reflection

#### Team Discussion (5 minutes)

**Instructor asks teams to discuss:**

1. **Share individual reflections**
2. **Identify common themes:**
   - What worked for multiple people?
   - What was hard for multiple people?
   - What did multiple people learn?

3. **Prepare to share:**
   - Choose 2-3 key insights
   - What should the class know?

#### Class Discussion (5 minutes)

**Instructor asks teams to share:**

**Round 1: What worked?**
- Ask 2-3 teams to share
- Highlight common themes
- Celebrate successes

**Round 2: What didn't work?**
- Ask 2-3 teams to share
- Normalize challenges
- Discuss how to address in Phase 2

**Round 3: What did we learn?**
- Ask 2-3 teams to share
- Highlight growth
- Connect to learning objectives

**Round 4: What will change?**
- Ask 2-3 teams to share
- Preview Phase 2
- Address concerns

**Common themes to highlight:**
- **What worked:** Testing, code review, pair programming, prototyping
- **What didn't:** Git conflicts, unclear requirements, time management
- **What we learned:** Technical skills, design thinking, collaboration
- **What will change:** Shared repo, vertical teams, more coordination

**Key Point:** "Retrospectives help us learn from experience. We'll do this regularly in Phase 2."

**Transition:** "Now let's understand Phase 2..."


### Part 4: Phase 2 Transition (15 minutes)

#### Phase 2 Overview (5 minutes)

**Instructor explains Phase 2:**

**Structure:**
- **Shared repo:** One repo for all teams
- **Vertical teams:** Backend + web + mobile developers together
- **Collaborative features:** Teams build features together
- **Agile workflow:** Sprints, standups, user stories

**Goals:**
- Build real features that work end-to-end
- Practice collaboration across teams
- Apply what we learned in Phase 1
- Prepare for real-world development

**Key Point:** "Phase 2 is about applying what we learned. We'll work together to build real features."

#### Shared Repo Workflow (5 minutes)

**Instructor explains:**

1. **Main branch:**
   - Protected (can't commit directly)
   - Always up to date
   - Represents working state

2. **Feature branches:**
   - One branch per feature
   - Named: `feature/[feature-name]`
   - Keep updated with `main` (rebase regularly)

3. **PR workflow:**
   - Create PR from feature branch to `main`
   - Get review (from different team if possible)
   - Address feedback
   - Merge when approved

4. **Coordination:**
   - Daily standups (what did you do? what will you do? blockers?)
   - API contracts (discuss before implementing)
   - Communication (Slack, GitHub discussions)

**Key Point:** "Shared repo requires coordination. Communication is essential."

#### Vertical Team Formation (5 minutes)

**Instructor explains:**

**Vertical teams:**
- Mix of backend, web, and mobile developers
- Work together on one feature
- Each person contributes their expertise
- Learn from each other

**Team formation:**
- Instructor assigns teams (or teams form based on interests)
- Each team gets assigned a feature
- Teams create Phase 2 working agreement

**Feature assignment:**
- Features are broken into user stories
- Teams plan first sprint
- Define API contracts

**Key Point:** "Vertical teams let us build features end-to-end. We'll learn from each other."

**Transition:** "After spring break, we'll start Phase 2..."


### Part 5: Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Reminders (3 minutes)
- **Spring break:** March 10-14 (no class)
- **Phase 2 starts:** March 17 (after spring break)
- **HW7 due:** March 17 (Phase 1 reflection + Phase 2 preparation)
- **Next class:** Agile introduction + vertical team formation

#### Questions (2 minutes)
- Open floor for questions
- Address concerns about Phase 2
- Provide resources for spring break (if needed)


## Materials Needed

- Demo setup (projector, screens, etc.)
- Retrospective framework (handout or digital)
- Phase 2 overview (handout or digital)
- Shared repo workflow guide (handout or digital)


## Instructor Notes

### Common Issues

**Issue: Demos run too long**  
Solution: Set clear time limits, gently interrupt, keep schedule

**Issue: Retrospective is surface-level**  
Solution: Provide specific prompts, encourage honesty, model deep reflection

**Issue: Teams are anxious about Phase 2**  
Solution: Acknowledge concerns, explain support available, emphasize learning together

**Issue: Teams don't understand shared repo workflow**  
Solution: Provide clear documentation, offer office hours, practice in class

### Time Management

- **If running short:** Shorten demos, focus on key retrospective questions
- **If running long:** Move some Phase 2 overview to next class, focus on demos and retrospective

### Differentiation

- **For advanced students:** Have them help explain concepts, lead discussions
- **For struggling students:** Provide more support, simpler explanations, check in individually


## Student Deliverables

- Demo completed (shown in class)
- Phase 1 reflection (can be part of HW7)
- Understanding of Phase 2 structure


## Next Steps

- **Spring break:** March 10-14 (rest, catch up, prepare for Phase 2)
- **After spring break:** Phase 2 begins (Agile, vertical teams, shared repo)
- **Homework:** HW7 due Tuesday, Mar 17 (Phase 1 reflection + Phase 2 preparation)
