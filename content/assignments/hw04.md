For this homework assignment, your team will implement **Module CRUD in the web UI**, similar to the reference implementation in the instructor’s `health-app` UI. This involves

1. Implementing **Create / Read / Update / Delete** for Modules in `tma-starter-app/ui`.  
2. Handling **loading / error / empty / success** states.  
3. Keeping your code TypeScript-safe and easy to adjust if your endpoint shape changes.  

You can parallelize this work if you agree on shared types + helper functions early. Start by creating GitHub issues that match the "Person X checklist" items in [Section 6](#s6), then have each person work from their issues.

## 1. New Files to Add <span id="s1"></span>

Your UI does not need to match these files exactly, but the behavior should feel similar.

| Component | File |
|----------|------|
| Create module page | `ui/src/pages/courses/CreateModulePage.tsx` |
| Module detail page (edit + delete) | `ui/src/pages/courses/ModuleDetailPage.tsx` |
| Edit modal | `ui/src/components/courses/EditModuleModal.tsx` |
| Module API helpers (Module section) | `ui/src/utils/api.ts` |
| Module types (Module section) | `health-app/ui/src/types/api.ts` | 

## 2. Team workflow requirement <span id="s2"></span>

1. Each teammate must open at least one PR that includes React/TypeScript changes.  
2. All HW4 changes must be merged into `main` by the deadline.  
3. Before coding, create issues for your work:
   1. Make 1+ GitHub issues per teammate (one per "Person X checklist" in [Section 6](#s6) works well).
   2. Put a short checklist + acceptance criteria in each issue (what should work when you’re done).
   3. Assign each issue to one person.
   4. Each PR should reference the issue(s) it addresses (and close them when merged).

## 3. UI requirements (Module CRUD) <span id="s3"></span>

### 3.1. Where the UI should live <span id="s31"></span> <span class="badge">Everyone</span>

1. Add Module UI under the Course area (recommended), so Modules feel “part of Courses”.  
2. At minimum, support deep links to a module page via a route (not just a modal).  

### 3.2. Routes <span id="s32"></span> <span class="badge">Person 1</span>

Add routes in `tma-starter-app/ui/src/App.tsx` similar to how other dashboard routes are defined.

1. Create module route (example): `/dashboard/courses/:courseId/modules/new`  
2. Module detail route (example): `/dashboard/courses/:courseId/modules/:moduleId`  

If your backend does not use `courseId` in the module endpoints, you can still keep these routes for the UI.

### 3.3. List/Read <span id="s33"></span> <span class="badge">Person 2</span>

1. Update the course detail page (`tma-starter-app/ui/src/pages/courses/CourseDetailPage.tsx`) to show a Modules section.  
2. Show a “Create Module” action that navigates to the create page route.  
3. Each module should be clickable to navigate to its Module detail route.  
4. Handle UI states: loading, error, empty, success.  

### 3.4. Create <span id="s34"></span> <span class="badge">Person 3</span>

1. Build a Create Module page with a simple form:
   * `title` (required)  
   * `description` (optional)  
   * `color` (optional)  

2. On submit, call your backend “create module” endpoint and then navigate back to the course detail page (or the new module’s detail page).  

3. You can eventually refactor this page’s form into a reusable component (for example, to reuse it in a modal).


### 3.5. Update <span id="s35"></span> <span class="badge">Person 4</span>

1. On the Module detail page, provide an “Edit” action.  
2. Your edit UI can be a modal (like the reference) or a separate edit page.  
3. On submit, call your backend “update module” endpoint and refresh the displayed module data.  

### 3.6. Delete <span id="s36"></span> <span class="badge">Person 5 (optional)</span>

1. On the Module detail page, provide a “Delete” action.  
2. Ask for confirmation before deleting.  
3. If delete succeeds, navigate back to the course detail page (or a modules list).  
4. If delete fails (for example due to dependencies), show the error message.  

## 4. TypeScript + code organization requirements <span id="s4"></span> <span class="badge">Person 1</span> <span class="badge">Everyone</span>

1. Define `Module`, `ModuleCreate`, and `ModuleUpdate` types that match your backend.  
2. No `any` for module data or props.  
3. Put module API calls in one place (either):

   * Add a “Module API” section to `tma-starter-app/ui/src/utils/api.ts`, or  
   * Create a new file like `tma-starter-app/ui/src/utils/modulesApi.ts`).  


## 5. Minimal testing requirement <span id="s5"></span>

1. Add 2 Vitest tests for one pure helper you wrote for this feature (examples: `buildModulesUrl`, `normalizeApiError`, `validateModuleTitle`).  
2. Keep tests small: test logic, not Mantine widgets.  

## 6. Suggested Division of Labor <span id="s6"></span>

### Person 1 (shared foundations)

- [ ] Add/confirm `Module`, `ModuleCreate`, and `ModuleUpdate` types in one shared place (see [Section 4](#s4)). (`ui/src/types/api.ts`)
- [ ] Add module API helper functions in one shared place (see [Section 4](#s4)). (`ui/src/utils/api.ts` or `ui/src/utils/modulesApi.ts`)
- [ ] Add the Module create + detail routes in `tma-starter-app/ui/src/App.tsx` (see [Section 3.2](#s32)). (`ui/src/App.tsx`)
- [ ] Make sure other teammates can import the types + call the helpers without needing to know endpoint details.

### Person 2 (Course detail "Modules" section)

Update `ui/src/pages/courses/CourseDetailPage.tsx`.

- [ ] Update the course detail page to show a Modules section (see [Section 3.3](#s33)).
- [ ] Render the 4 UI states: loading, error, empty, success.
- [ ] Make each module clickable to navigate to the module detail route.
- [ ] Add a "Create Module" button/link that navigates to the create page route.

### Person 3 checklist (Create Module page)

Update `ui/src/pages/courses/CreateModulePage.tsx`.

- [ ] Build the Create Module page + form (see [Section 3.4](#s34)).
- [ ] Wire submit to the create endpoint via the shared API helpers.
- [ ] Show loading + errors on submit.
- [ ] Navigate after success (back to course detail or to the new module's detail).

### Person 4 checklist (Module detail + Edit)

Update `ui/src/pages/courses/ModuleDetailPage.tsx` (and optionally `ui/src/components/courses/EditModuleModal.tsx` if using a modal for editing).

- [ ] Build the Module detail page (see [Section 3.2](#s32) + [Section 3.5](#s35)).
- [ ] Fetch and display one module (loading/error/success states).
- [ ] Add an Edit action (modal or page) and wire it to the update endpoint.
- [ ] Refresh the displayed module data after a successful update.

### Person 5 checklist (optional: Delete + testing + polish)

- [ ] Add Delete on the Module detail page with confirmation (see [Section 3.6](#s36)). (`ui/src/pages/courses/ModuleDetailPage.tsx`)
- [ ] Handle delete failures with a clear error message. (`ui/src/pages/courses/ModuleDetailPage.tsx`)
- [ ] Add the minimal Vitest tests for a pure helper (see [Section 5](#s5)). (`ui/src/utils/api.test.ts` or similar)
- [ ] Do a quick UI polish pass (labels, spacing, empty states).

## 7. Individual Reflection

Each student must complete an individual reflection in their shared Google document (`LastName_FirstName_373`).

Under today's date, respond (200–350 words total):

1. How did working with shared types and API helpers (or coordinating without them) affect your development process?
1. What was most challenging about building the Module CRUD UI? Why?
1. Since you're working with a new team for this assignment, how did you establish workflow and coordinate work? What worked well, and what would you do differently?

Paste your reflection into the [Weekly Reflection Form](https://forms.gle/m6Myw4Lxc2We3WNCA) as usual.
