## Overview

This assignment has three parts:
1. **Build React UI** - Your team builds a React UI that connects to an existing backend feature
2. **Peer Review** - You review another team's frontend PR
3. **Individual Reflection** - Reflect on what's different about frontend, what clicked, and what's confusing

This assignment builds on React architecture, TypeScript, Contexts, and Hooks from class. You'll practice building frontend features and connecting them to backend APIs.


## Part 1: Build React UI (60 points)

### Instructions

Your team will build a React UI that connects to an existing backend feature. You'll use TypeScript, React Contexts, and Hooks to create a functional frontend interface.

### Requirements

#### 1. Choose a Backend Feature (5 points)

**Select an existing backend feature to build a UI for:**

**Options:**
- **Groups:** List groups, view group details, create group
- **Courses:** List courses, view course details, create course
- **Modules:** List modules in a course, view module details
- **Posts:** List posts in a module, view post details
- **Or another feature** (check with instructor first)

**Requirements:**
- Feature must have existing backend API endpoints
- Feature should have at least 2-3 endpoints (GET list, GET one, POST/PATCH)
- Feature should be meaningful (not too simple, not too complex)

**Documentation:**
In your PR description, list the feature you chose and which endpoints you're using.

#### 2. Design UI Flow (10 points)

**Before coding, design your UI:**

1. **Map backend to frontend:**
   - What pages do you need?
   - What components do you need?
   - What state do you need? (local vs global)
   - How does data flow?

2. **Identify UI states:**
   - Loading states
   - Error states
   - Empty states
   - Success states

3. **Identify edge cases:**
   - What if API is slow?
   - What if network fails?
   - What if data is empty?
   - What if user is unauthorized?

**Submission:**
Include your UI flow design in your PR description or as a file in the PR.

**Template:**
```markdown
## UI Flow Design

### Pages
- `/feature` - List view
- `/feature/new` - Create form
- `/feature/{id}` - Detail view

### Components
- `FeatureList` - Displays list
- `FeatureCard` - Displays one item
- `FeatureForm` - Form for creating/editing
- `FeatureDetail` - Shows details

### State
- **Local:**
  - Form inputs (in FeatureForm)
  - Loading states (in pages)
- **Global:**
  - User authentication (from AuthContext)

### UI States
- Loading: Fetching data
- Error: API error, network error
- Empty: No data exists
- Success: Data loaded

### Edge Cases
- User has no items (empty state)
- API returns 401 (unauthorized - redirect to login)
- Network timeout (show error, retry button)
```

#### 3. Implement Pages (20 points)

**Create React page components:**

1. **List Page:**
   - Fetch and display list of items
   - Handle loading, error, and empty states
   - Navigate to detail pages
   - Use TypeScript types

2. **Detail Page (optional but recommended):**
   - Fetch and display one item
   - Handle loading and error states
   - Show related data if applicable

3. **Create/Edit Page (optional but recommended):**
   - Form for creating/editing items
   - Form validation
   - Submit to backend API
   - Handle success and error states

**Requirements:**
- Pages use TypeScript (proper types)
- Pages handle all UI states (loading, error, empty, success)
- Pages use React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Pages connect to backend API correctly
- Pages use AuthContext for authentication

**Example structure:**
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '../../contexts/AuthContext';
import { Group } from '../../types/api';

export default function GroupsPage() {
  const { API_URL, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
  const [groups, setGroups] = useState<Group[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchGroups() {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/groups`, {
          headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
          }
        });
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch');
        const data = await response.json();
        setGroups(data);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Unknown error');
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }
    fetchGroups();
  }, [API_URL]);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  if (groups.length === 0) return <div>No groups found</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Groups</h1>
      {groups.map(group => (
        <div key={group.id}>{group.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 4. Create Components (10 points)

**Create reusable React components:**

1. **List Component:**
   - Displays list of items
   - Receives data via props
   - Handles item selection/navigation

2. **Card/Item Component:**
   - Displays one item
   - Receives item data via props
   - Handles click events

3. **Form Component (if applicable):**
   - Form inputs
   - Form validation
   - Submit handler

**Requirements:**
- Components use TypeScript (proper prop types)
- Components are reusable
- Components focus on presentation (receive data via props)
- Components are well-named and clear

**Example:**
```typescript
interface GroupCardProps {
  group: Group;
  onSelect: (id: number) => void;
}

export function GroupCard({ group, onSelect }: GroupCardProps) {
  return (
    <div onClick={() => onSelect(group.id)}>
      <h3>{group.name}</h3>
      <p>{group.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 5. Use Contexts and Hooks (10 points)

**Use React Contexts and Hooks appropriately:**

1. **AuthContext:**
   - Use for authentication state
   - Use for API_URL
   - Check authentication before rendering

2. **useState:**
   - Local component state
   - Form inputs, loading states, error states

3. **useEffect:**
   - Fetch data on component mount
   - Handle side effects
   - Clean up if needed

4. **Custom Hooks (optional but recommended):**
   - Extract reusable logic
   - Example: `useGroups()`, `useFeature()`

**Requirements:**
- Contexts used for global state (auth, API config)
- useState used for local state
- useEffect used for data fetching
- Hooks used correctly (dependencies, cleanup)

**Example custom hook:**
```typescript
export function useGroups() {
  const { API_URL } = useAuth();
  const [groups, setGroups] = useState<Group[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchGroups() {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/groups`);
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch');
        const data = await response.json();
        setGroups(data);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Unknown error');
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }
    fetchGroups();
  }, [API_URL]);

  return { groups, loading, error };
}
```

#### 6. Handle UI States and Edge Cases (5 points)

**Handle all UI states and edge cases:**

1. **Loading states:**
   - Show loading indicator while fetching
   - Prevent multiple simultaneous requests

2. **Error states:**
   - Display error messages
   - Provide retry functionality
   - Handle network errors gracefully

3. **Empty states:**
   - Show message when no data exists
   - Provide actions (create new item)

4. **Success states:**
   - Display data correctly
   - Handle navigation after actions

**Requirements:**
- All UI states handled
- Edge cases considered
- User-friendly error messages
- Appropriate loading indicators
