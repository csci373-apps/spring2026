## Tips for Success

### Reflection
- **Be honest:** What was hard? What did you learn?
- **Be specific:** Give examples from your experience
- **Be reflective:** Think about what you learned, not just what you did
- **Connect the dots:** How do different experiences relate?

### Phase 2 Preparation
- **Ask questions:** If something is unclear, ask
- **Be proactive:** Don't wait until Phase 2 starts
- **Work together:** Prepare as a team
- **Be realistic:** Plan for what you can actually do

### Time Management
- **Start early:** Don't wait until the last minute
- **Break it down:** Reflection and preparation are separate tasks
- **Work together:** Team preparation can be collaborative


## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Reflection is too surface-level
**Solution:** Be specific, give examples, think deeply about what you learned

### Issue: Don't know what to reflect on
**Solution:** Review your Phase 1 work, think about what was hard, what clicked, what surprised you

### Issue: Don't understand Phase 2 features
**Solution:** Ask questions, review feature descriptions, discuss with team

### Issue: Sprint plan is unrealistic
**Solution:** Start small, break features into small tasks, be conservative with estimates


## Resources

- **Phase 1 work:** Review your PRs, code, and reflections
- **Shared repo:** Explore the repository structure
- **Feature descriptions:** Review assigned features
- **Agile resources:** (from class readings and activities)


## Next Steps

After completing this assignment, you'll:
- Have synthesized your Phase 1 learning
- Understand what you learned and how you grew
- Be prepared for Phase 2 (shared repo, vertical teams, features)
- Have a plan for your first sprint

**Phase 2 starts:** Tuesday, March 17 (after spring break)

Good luck with Phase 2!
