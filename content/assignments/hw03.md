## 1. Coding & Analysis Task
For Homework 3, please complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a_liQ8fj5Xz62MGFZCqMI-8G725TQ2lr_33S6ekU2Kg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">refactoring exercise</a> you started in class with your partner. There should be at least 2 refactors per team.

## 2. Individual Reflection

Each student must complete an individual reflection in their shared Google document (`LastName_FirstName_373`).

Under today's date, respond (200–350 words total):

1. What did you refactor?
1. Why did you choose that refactor?
1. What risks or tradeoffs did you consider, and how did existing tests help you refactor safely?

Paste your reflection into the [Weekly Reflection Form](https://forms.gle/m6Myw4Lxc2We3WNCA) as usual.
